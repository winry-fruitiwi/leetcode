class Solution:
    # takes in the string s and turns it into a palindrome
    # by replacing as few letters as possible. breaks tie by
    # checking the lexicographical value of the current letter.

        # iterate through the string starting from 0 and ending at half the length (rounded down)
        # the reason why we're iterating to half the length is because we already
        # know what the other half of the characters we are iterating over are
        
            # get the letter at i
